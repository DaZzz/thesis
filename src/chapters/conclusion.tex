used roads when traveling from particular region to all other locations of the city. The service
provides global overview of the city in terms of prevailing transport for each region, fastest
and slowest roads. Accessibility level is calculated for each region, allowing to filter and
discover most accessible and least accessible parts of the city.

The software is developed applying cutting-edge techniques in web development which resulted
in highly responsive systems and helped to achieve insignificant delays. The reliability of the
system was proved by test driven development approach. All of the provided software requirements
were satisfied.

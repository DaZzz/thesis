\section{CONCLUSION}

The system for transport accessibility analysis of Moscow was developed, which allows to explore
regions of the city. The program allows to browse locations, see and examine what are the most
used roads when traveling from particular region to all other locations of the city. The service
provides global overview of the city in terms of prevailing transport for each region, fastest
and slowest roads. Accessibility level is calculated for each region allowing to filter and
discover most accessible and least accessible parts of the city.

The software is developed applying cutting-edge techniques in the web development what resulted in
highly responsive systems and helped to achieve insignificantly small delays. The reliability of the
system was proved by test driven development approach. All of the provided software requirements
were satisfied.

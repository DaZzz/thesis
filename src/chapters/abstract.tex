In this thesis the process of building a software for transport accessibility
analysis is described. The goal was to create a software which is easy to distribute and
simple to use for the user without particular background in the field of the geographical
data analysis. It was  shown that existing tools does not suit for this particular task due
to complex interface or significant rendering time. The goal was accomplished by applying modern
approaches in the process of building web applications such as FLUX architecture design pattern and
module bundling. For the maps rendering it was shown that vector tiles have considerable
advantage over image-based tiles.

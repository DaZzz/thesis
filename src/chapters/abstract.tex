In this thesis the process of building a software for transport accessibility analysis is described.
The goal was to create a software which is easy to distribute and simple to use for the user without
particular background in the field of the geographical data analysis. It was  shown that existing
tools do not suit for this particular task due to complex interface or significant rendering time.
The goal was accomplished by applying modern approaches in the process of building web applications
such as maps based on vector tiles, FLUX architecture design pattern and module bundling. It was
discovered that vector tiles have considerable advantages over image-based tiles such as faster
rendering and real-time styling.

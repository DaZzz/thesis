First, I would like to thank my supervisors -- Vitaliy Bragilevsky and Arto Kaarna for
help and support in course of choosing topic and writing this thesis.

Second, I am happy that I was able to do this work in Lappeenranta University of Technology,
where I had personal space to work any time without being disturbed. I feel lucky for
working in Machine Vision Laboratory where people created the warmest atmosphere to work in.

Finally, I would like to thank Vadim Smakhtin and Eduard Haiman for providing me with topic
for research. I think I learned a lot from this collaboration.
